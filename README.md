### About Go Social!
Go Social! is a modern social media platform powered by the Open Source Social Network (OSSN). It is founded and became live on the public on April 3, 2023 (Monday). This platform aims to have an "open" social media platform.

Go Social! has its platform hosted on x10 Hosting's (Free hosting) infrastructure. While, its founder is living in the Philippines. It has all the features you need for a functional social media platform (Chats, Notifications, Games, Newsfeed, Photos, Arcade Games, Search and Groups).

This platform is owned by the management of Go Social!, while its presence is for the general public.

This social media platform started from a curious man in the Philippines (@thedoggybrad) that wanted to create a small social media platform and saw the Friendster.Click platform (not to be confused by the original Friendster, now bankrupt and closed) which was based on WordPress with some plugins, but he thinks that WordPress is too heavy for a social media site and it lacks features. Later, the founder saw the Open Source Social Network software and decided to experiment with it, that experiment becomes Go Social! The founder's GitHub account is @thedoggybrad.

This platform and its founder is not accepting any donations or anything similar (sponsorships or ads), since this platform is a non-profit and cost-free social media platform.

This platform uses a free ZERO SSL certificate, a CloudFlare Free CDN, X10's Free Hosting and free subdomains. So do not blame anyone about the speed and performance of this social media platform because it is all free, as this platform is a non-profit and cost-free social media platform.

Mission: To provide a free, open, safe and privacy-friendly platform to all the people around the world, that treats them with respect and care.

Vision: Our Vision is to add more features in the platform, secure it more and have many people join the platform. We are also viewing that the people using this platform will receive and be treated with our 4 principles (free, open, safe and privacy-friendly).
